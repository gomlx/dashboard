## Goals

* Easy to include as a library -- similar API to the [existing progress-bar](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gomlx/gomlx@v0.20.1/ui/commandline#AttachProgressBar), but it will instead start an HTTP server and open the browser.
* To be included in the [`gomlx_checkpoints`](https://github.com/gomlx/gomlx/tree/main/cmd/gomlx_checkpoints) command-line tool.
